I cannot lose "my job" because it is not my job in the first place. J cannot 
do me any harm - he cannot take anything away from me.  MY thing is my
career and business contacts, which I am 100% in control of (under God).
Retain my calm confidence!!  My professionalism and business sense.
I have my current contract, my current position.  And I have my network,
and will keep communicating my way to my next opportunity. 
I am a software engineer, NOT just a programmer!  Forget the nonsense
programmer tests.  SHOW how I am a problem solver, an innovater, a solution
architect, a professional.  BE more, rise above, pull it up higher if they
try to put me in some nonsense online test or code monkey white board
session.  Talk them out of it, pull the conversation to where my
highest value is!

Largely, take advantage of them.  Or take advantage of the situation.
Or the opportunity.  Make 100% my top goal be to gain the new knowledge,
networking, and experience to get the next better job and higher pay
package.  I work for God and my career is in his hands.  I work for God
and work with him.
